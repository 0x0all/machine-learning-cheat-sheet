\chapter{K-Nearest Neighbors}


\section{Representation}

\begin{equation}
y=f(\vec{x})=\arg\min_{c}{\sum\limits_{\vec{x}_i \in N_k(\vec{x})} \mathbb{I}(y_i=c)}
\end{equation}
where $N_k(\vec{x})$ is the set of k points that are closest to point $\vec{x}$.

Usually use \textbf{k-d tree} to accelerate the process of finding k nearest points.
